# Fe-Sign-Up-Form

Single page app with Sign Up Form, built with latest Angular

## Start the application

First go to the app folder and install dependencies with `npm i`;<br/>
After that is done: run `ng serve` (or `npm start`). <br/> 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. <br/> 
(The command will start a dev server and will automatically reload the page if you change any of the source files.)

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project (or `npm run build`). <br/> 
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. <br/>
Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` (or `npm run test`) to execute the unit tests (using Karma).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests (using Cypress). <br/>
For this to work correctly - application should be shut down first.
